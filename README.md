Frontend The Shop page allows users to browse all dishes from various
restaurants and select dishes from a single restaurant. Clicking on a restaurant
name will display only the dishes it offers. When a dish is clicked, it is added
to the customer's cart. The Shopping Cart page displays the selected dishes in
the cart and allows users to place an order after entering their information
into the form. Dishes can be removed from the cart and the quantity of each
selected dish can be modified. The frontend is deployed on GH Pages at the
following address: https://vitaliishv.github.io/delivery/. Repository:
https://github.com/VitaliiShv/delivery.

Backend JSON files were used as the database for the backend. The backend is
deployed on render.com, and the link to access it is:
